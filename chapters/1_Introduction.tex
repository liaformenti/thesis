\section{Introduction}
% --------------------------------------------------

The High-Lumnosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project was approved to combat the plateau in statistial gain of recording particle collisions at the LHC at CERN~\cite{hl_lhc_tdr}. Being the most energetic particle accelerator, the LHC still offers unique physics opportunities for studying the Higgs and electroweak sectors of the standard model\cite{dainese_physics_2018}; if the study at the energy frontier is to continue, the LHC must go on. The HL-LHC upgrade aims to increase the luminosity of the LHC by up to a factor of 7 in the next 10 years, which ultimately increases the number of meaningful collisions. Naturally, various sub-systems of the experiments used to capture the outcomes of the collisions will require upgrades to handle higher collision rates and background radiation rates than they were designed for. 

The ATLAS experiment~\cite{collaboration_atlas_2008} is one of the LHC's general-purpose particle detector arrays. The largest upgrade the ATLAS experiment will undergo is the replacement of the small wheels of the muon spectrometer with the so-called New Small Wheels (NSWs)~\cite{nsw_tdr}. Two different detector technologies will be installed: micromegas, and small-strip thin gap chambers (or sTGCs). In this work, the main dataset used to correct for the internal alignment of sTGC components (the x-ray dataset~\cite{lefebvre_precision_2020}) is validated with characterization data collected on the sTGCs using cosmic muons. How the internal alignment fits into the overall alignment system is also detailed. 

In this chapter, the experimental setup of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC is presented, and the NSW upgrade is motivated and detailed before later chapters explain how sTGC characterization datasets are being used for alignment, with a focus on the cosmic muon dataset.

% Include order for inst lum.
% Include bunch crossing frequency
The LHC is an accelerator \SI{27}{\kilo\meter} in circumference and located $\sim$\SI{100}{\meter} underground at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland~\cite{evans_lhc_2008}. It has two beam pipes that counter-circulate bunches of protons\footnote{the LHC also accelerates lead ions, but this paper only considers proton-proton collisions} before colliding the bunches in the center of one of four major experiments, such as the ATLAS experiment (discussed in section~\ref{sec:atlas}). There, the partons interact and many physics processes can occur. The LHC enables physicists to study particle physics at the energy frontier. In the previous run of the LHC (run-2), protons were collided with a center of mass energy of \SI{13}{\tera\electronvolt}. 

% There are two main branches of study that can be pursued with the LHC and ATLAS. First, properties predicted by the standard model (SM) of particle physics can be measured. Else, physicists can search for evidence of processes predicted by theories beyond the standard model. Both the SM measurement and search analyses are based on measuring the number of times a given process occurs and comparing it to expectations. In this way, the number of proton-proton interactions created by the LHC directly affects the statistics available to do SM measurements and searches using the ATLAS experiment.


The number of proton-proton interactions generated by the LHC directly affects the statistics available to make fundamental measurements of cross sections, event rates, etc. 
%IF YOU DON'T NEED TO DEFINE LUMINOSITY
% The number of interactions is quantified by luminosity, a property of the accelerator and its operating conditions~\cite{zyla_review_2020}. When the instantaneous luminosity is integrated over a data collection period and multiplied by the cross section of a given process, the result is the expected number of times that process occurs (so luminosity has units of inverse cross section). Since luminosity is derived from the accelerator parameters, it is the link between the machine and the statistical power of potential measurements. 
% IF YOU NEED TO DEFINE LUMINOSITY
% THIS SECTION IS NOT CITED, probably cite wiht zyla_review_2020
Predicting the number of proton-proton interactions requires defining a metric called luminosity~\cite{zyla_review_2020}. It is the number of particles an accelerator can send through a given area per unit time. It is calculated from the measurable quantities in equation~\ref{eqn:inst_lum}.

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \frac{f N_{1} N_{2} }{4 \pi \sigma_{x} \sigma_{y}}
\label{eqn:inst_lum}
\end{equation}

In equation~\ref{eqn:inst_lum}, $f$ is the frequency of the bunch crossings (\SI{25}{\nano\second}), $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ are the number of protons in each bunch ($\sim 10^{11}$ protons / bunch), and $\sigma_{x}$ and $\sigma_{y}$ are the RMS of the spatial distributions of the bunch. Therefore, luminosity is a property of the accelerator and its operating parameters. The design luminosity of the LHC was $10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. The units of luminosity are an inverse area; multiplying the luminosity by the cross section of a given process gives the expected rate for that process.

Integrating the \textit{instantaneous} luminosity (equation~\ref{eqn:inst_lum}) over a period of data collection gives the integrated luminosity,

\begin{equation}
L = \int \mathcal{L} \left( t \right) \,dt
\label{eqn:int_lum}
\end{equation}

which is related to the total number of interactions. In this way, the luminosity is the link between the accelerator and the statistical power of measurements to be made with the data collected. 

So far, the LHC provided an integrated luminosity of \SI{28.26}{\per\femto\barn} in run-1~\cite{atlas_luminosity_run1} and \SI{156}{\per\femto\barn} in run-2~\cite{atlas_luminosity_run2}, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:hl-lhc}. The HL-LHC upgrade~\cite{hl_lhc_tdr} was accepted because without increasing the luminosity of the LHC tenfold, running the accelerator will not provide significant statistical gain on measurements. Also, some systems will need repair and replacement to operate past $\sim$2020. The energy accessible at the LHC offers irreplaceable ability to study Higgs- and electroweak-sector physics~\cite{dainese_physics_2018}, so the European Strategy for Particle Physics made it a priority ``to fully exploit the physics potential of the LHC'' with ``a major luminosity upgrade''~\cite{european_strategy_for_particle_physics}. The goal is for the HL-LHC to provide an integrated luminosity of \SI{3000}{\per\femto\barn} in the 12 years following the upgrade. The luminosity actually achieved will depend on a combination of technological advances and upgrades in progress that affect the factors contributing to luminosity defined in equation~\ref{eqn:inst_lum}~\cite{hl_lhc_tdr}.

\section{The ATLAS experiment}
% --------------------------------------------------
\label{sec:atlas}

The ATLAS experiment~\cite{collaboration_atlas_2008} was designed to support all the physics goals of the LHC. It is \SI{44}{\meter} long and \SI{25}{\meter} in diameter, and weighs 7000 tones. It is an array of particle detector subsystems arranged concentrically around the beam pipe and centered around one of the LHC's interaction points (a place where the beams collide), as shown in figure~\ref{fig:atlas}. ATLAS is cylindrical because it aims to provide 4$\pi$ coverage aound the interaction point. It is helpful to separate the subsystems of ATLAS into the so-called ``barrel'' and ``endcap'' or ``forward'' regions.  % <- maybe move this sentence to muon spec section

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{figures/atlas_diagram.png}
    \caption{Diagram of the ATLAS experiment, with the various detector subsystems labelled. Figure from~\cite{collaboration_atlas_2008}, which also contains more details about the ATLAS experiment.}
    \label{fig:atlas}
\end{figure}

For analysis, ATLAS is typically described in spherical coordinates. The azimuthal angle $\phi$ is measured around the beampipe and the polar angle $\theta$ is measured from the beam pipe. A more useful coordinate than $\theta$ is the pseudo-rapidity, $\eta = -\ln\tan\left(\theta/2\right)$, because it approaches the rapidity of a particle when its momentum is much greater than its mass and differences in rapidity are approximately invariant to a Lorentz boost parallel to the beam. The range of $\eta$ is 0 (perpendicular to the beam) to $\pm\infty$ (parallel to the beam, or the z-direction). Typically, $\eta$ is the physically interesting coordinate because the $\phi$ coordinate follows the cylindrical symmetry of the beam.

It is not actually the proton bunches that collide and generate physics processes, but their constituent partons. Since the partons may carry an unknown fraction of the momentum, ATLAS analyses are based on the sum of the transverse momentum ($p_T$) and energy of outgoing particle being approximately zero (transverse meaning perpendicular to the beam). \textcolor{red}{The goal of ATLAS is to reconstruct the transverse momentum of each collision product to understand what happened in each collision. \textit{-> Do I have this right?}} A brief overview of the sub-systems of ATLAS is given, starting from the system closest to the beam and moving outwards. Each sub-system is responsible for a different group of collision products.

\textbf{The inner detector}

The inner detector~\cite{atlas_inner_detector_tdr_1, atlas_inner_detector_tdr_2} (figure~\ref{fig:atlas_inner_detector}) is for precision tracking, vertex measurements and electron identification. A \SI{2}{\tesla} solenoid with field parallel to the beam bends the track of outgoing particles to make momentum measurements possible. The innermost part is made of high-resolution semiconductor pixel and strip detectors for precision tracking while the outermost part are straw-tubes that generate and detect transition radiation for electron identification.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{figures/atlas_inner_detector.jpg}

    \label{fig:atlas_inner_detector}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Calorimeters}

Electromagnetic and hadronic sampling calorimeter units are used to record the energy of electrons, photons, jets and missing transverse energy (from neutrinos, for example). A combination of liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters~\cite{atlas_lar_cal_tdr} and tile-scintillator hadronic calorimeters~\cite{atlas_tile_cal_tdr} cover the rapidity range $|\eta| < 4.9$, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:atlas_calorimeter}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.5\textwidth]{figures/atlas_calorimeter.png}
    \caption{Diagram of the ATLAS calorimeter system, with the different segments and the technology used labelled. Figure from~\cite{collaboration_atlas_2008}.}
    \label{fig:atlas_calorimeter}
\end{figure}

The calorimeters cause incoming charged particles to shower and deposit their energy in the sensitive volume. Only muons and neutrinos are known to pass the calorimeters to the muon spectrometer.  Particles other than those mentioned would have decayed in the inner detector before reaching the calorimeter. 

\textbf{Trigger system}

It would be impossible to record all the data from bunch crossings every \SI{25}{\nano\second}, corresponding to a rate of $\sim$\SI{40}{MHz}, so ATLAS has a multi-level trigger system to select events of interest for permanent storage. The Level-1 (L1) hardware trigger~\cite{atlas_l1_trigger_tdr} uses partial-granularity information from the muon spectrometer and calorimeter to trigger on high $p_T$ muons, electrons, jets, high missing transverse energy, and $\tau$ decaying to hadrons. The maximum L1 trigger rate ATLAS can accommodate is \SI{100}{kHz} with a latency of \SI{2.5}{\micro\second}. 

% The Level-1 (L1) hardware trigger uses the muon spectrometer's TGCs and RPCs to trigger on high $p_T$ muons and the calorimeter detector units to trigger on electrons, jets, high missing transverse energy, and $\tau$ decaying to hadrons, with a maximum trigger rate of \SI{100}{kHz} and latency of \SI{2.5}{\micro\second}. The L1 trigger only uses a fraction of the granularity offered by the detectors.

The L1 trigger is used to define regions of interest that are fed into the software high level trigger (HLT), in which the full granularity of the muon spectrometer and calorimeter are used with information from the inner detector to reduce the trigger rate to 1 kHz. Events that pass the L1 and HLT trigger are recorded for use in offline analysis~\cite{atlas_hlt_trigger_tdr}.

The ATLAS trigger system is described in the references above but the trigger rates quoted here are after the upgrades implemented for run-2, described in~\cite{martinez_run-2_2016}.

\textbf{Muon spectrometer}

Magnetic deflection by superconducting air-core toroid magnets is used to measure muon momentum and energy. In the barrel of ATLAS, eight coils bent into ``racetracks'' are arranged around the beampipe provide the magentic field. In the forward region, two end-cap toroids each with eight smaller racetrack-shaped coils arranged symmetrically around the beampipe are inserted in the ends of the barrel toroid~\cite{atlas_magnet_tdr}. Figure~\ref{fig:atlas_muon_spectrometer} shows the toroid magnets and the different parts of the ATLAS muon spectrometer.

\label{fig:atlas_muon_spectrometer}
\end{figure}

The muon spectrometer~\cite{atlas_muon_spectrometer_tdr} is separated into detectors used for precision offline tracking and for triggering. Monitored drift tubes (MDTs) and cathode strip chambers (CSCs) are used for precision tracking; resistive plate chambers (RPCs) are used for triggering in the barrel and thin-gap chambers (TGCs) are used for triggering in the endcaps. The positions of each type of chamber are sketched in figure~\ref{fig:atlas_muon_spectrometer_cut}. 

Precision tracking is done offline for events passing the muon trigger. Each of the barrel and encap systems have three layers of MDTs that record the position of the muon as it passes through each layer. Knowing the magentic field, the muon's momentum can be extracted. For the design momentum resolution of $\Delta p_T / p_T <$ 1$\times$10$^{-4}~p$ / GeV for $p_T < 300 GeV$ and a few percent for lower $p_T$ muons, the MDTs and CSCs required position resolution of \SI{50}{\micro\meter} each. Accordingly, an optical alignment system was designed to monitor and correct for chamber positions~\cite{atlas_muon_spectrometer_tdr, aefsky_optical_2008}. 

% ON MUON TRIGGERING IN THE ENDCAP
% Decide how you want to do this based on the next section.
% At least 2 TGC layers in coincidence comes from muon spectrometer TDR; coincidence with "forward inner" detectors (small wheel) comes from run 2 trigger upgrades paper, Martinez.
% NSW TDR says there are TGC layers in the small wheel that are the forward inner detectors added to run 2 triggering.
% \textcolor{red}{The run 2 L1 muon trigger was passed if TGC layers (two for low $p_T$ muons, three for high $p_T$ muons) of the big wheel fired in coincidence with a hit from the MDTs of the small wheel on the order of the bunch crossing time. The regions of interest defined by the TGCs were fed into the HLT, where MDT and TGC data could be combined for further cuts. The $p_T$ resolution of the L1 trigger is improved by the MDT tracking information. \textit{I'll decide how I want to do this after writing the motivation for the NSW}}
In run 1, low (high) $p_T$ muons were triggered on at L1 if two (three) of the RPCs or TGCs layers fired in coincidence, for the barrel and encaps respectively~\cite{atlas_l1_trigger_tdr}. After run 1 it was discovered that up to 90\% of the triggers in the endcap were fake, caused by background particles generated in the material between the small wheel and the big wheel~\cite{nsw_tdr}. In run 1, only the TGC layers surrounding the big wheel were included in the trigger. To reduce the fake rate in run 2, the TGCs on the inside of the small wheel were also included. The added condition reduced the trigger rate by 50\% in the range 1.3 $< |\eta| <$ 1.9~\cite{martinez_run-2_2016}. The effectiveness of the solution was limited since the $|\eta|$-range of the small wheel TGCs was limited to 1.0 $< |\eta| <$ 1.9 and the position resolution of the small wheel TGCs is coarse~\cite{nsw_tdr}.

% In the barrel, three layers of MDTs are used for precision tracking, and resistive plate chambers (RPCs) are used for triggering. The endcaps of the muon spectrometer are composed of three wheels each, the small wheel (SW), big wheel, and outer wheel. All three wheels use MDTs for precision offline tracking, but cathode strip chambers (CSCs) are used in the forward region of the small wheel because they can better handle the increased background. Thin gap  chambers

% The big wheel and the outer wheel have MDTs for offline precision tracking and the thin gap chambers (TGCs) on either side for triggering. In the first two runs of ATLAS, offline precision tracking on the small wheel was done with MDTs and cathode strip chambers (CSCs), and their output did not contribute to the trigger.~\cite{atlas_muon_spectrometer_tdr}. 

% Sentences if you go without 1/4 cut figure
% In the barrel, three layers of monitored drift tubes (MDTs) are arranged between, above and below the barrel toroid magnets. They are used for precision tracking. On both sides of the middle layer of  MDTs and on the top of the top layer of MDTs are resitive plate chambers (RPCs), used for triggering.
%  The inner part had cathode strip chambers (CSCs), which had higher granularity to handle the increased background radiation rate in the forward region

% The muon spectrometer is the outermost layer of the ATLAS detector, since only muons (and neutrinos) can pass through the calorimeters. For muons that are ejected towards the end-caps of ATLAS, their trajectory is bent by the magentic field and their position recorded by three successive wheels of muon detectors. With each wheel providing the position of the muon along its trajectory and knowledge of the magentic field, the momentum of the muon generated in the collision can be reconstructed. 

% --------------------------------------------------
\section{Motivation for the New Small Wheels (NSWs)}
% --------------------------------------------------

At the end of the HL-LHC upgrade, there could be up to a sevenfold increase in luminosity~\cite{hl_lhc_tdr}. Simultaneously, the background radiation rate increases linearly with luminosity. The combined rate presents problems for both the tracking and triggering capabilities of the muon spectrometer~\cite{nsw_tdr}.

In term of tracking, the efficiency of the MDTs decreases by 35\% (mostly due to long dead-times) already when exposed to the maximum hit rate at the current luminosity, 300 kHz.
At a threefold increase in luminosity, which is predicted for run 3, most of the SW will be subjected to a hit rate well above 300 kHz. Losing muon hits in the small wheel will reduce the high $p_T$ muon momentum resolution. The decrease in resolution will affect the ability to search for high mass $Z'$, $W'$ and pseudo-scalar Higgs~\cite{nsw_tdr}.

Already, the forward muon trigger system copes with a very high fake rate, even when including TGC data from the SW in the trigger as in run-2. At the luminosity expected in run 3, 60 kHz of the maximum 100 kHz of the L1 trigger would be taken by the endcap muon spectrometer. A possible solution would be to raise the minimum $p_T$ threshold from \SI{20}{\giga\electronvolt} to \SI{40}{\giga\electronvolt}, but the ability to study several physics processes of interest depend on low $p_T$ muons~\cite{nsw_tdr}

The NSW will solve both these problems. It will be covered with precision tracking chambers suitable for the expected hit rates and triggering chambers capable of \SI{1}{mrad} angular resolution. The idea behind the triggering chambers is to match the small wheel track segment with the track segment from the big wheel to discard tracks not originating from the interaction point. Figure~\ref{fig:nsw_track_triggering} illustrates this point: the old trigger system would have triggered on all three tracks, while with the NSW the trigger system would only trigger on track A~\cite{nsw_tdr}.

% Currently, the small wheel is made of thin-gap chambers, which record hits. They have the known problem that particles generated in the material of the end-cap toroid magnet that hit the small wheel cannot be distinguished from muons from the interaction point. For example, in figure~\ref{fig:nsw_track_triggering}, all three tracks would be triggered on.

    \caption{A schematic of a quarter cross section of the ATLAS detector, with the collision/interaction point (IP) in the bottom left corner. Three possible tracks are labelled. Ideally, track A would be triggered upon while track B and C discarded. With the small wheel, all three tracks would be recorded. With the new small wheel, only track A would be recorded~\cite{nsw_tdr}.}

\end{figure}

\section{Design of the NSWs}
% --------------------------------------------------

The NSWs are covered with two detector technologies: micromegas (MM) and small-strip thin gap chambers (sTGCs). MMs are the primary tracking detectors and sTGCs are the primary triggering detectors, but for redundancy sake both are designed to do either. As such, both sets of detectors are to have position resolution better than $\sim$\SI{100}{\micro\meter} per plane. \textcolor{red}{\textit{Is quoting 100 um ok? Originally in the TDR, it was smaller, but given how detector construction has played out I think this is the new working goal}}. Four chambers of each type are glued together to create quadruplet modules. Quadruplets of different sizes are assembled into wedges. Two sTGC wedges and two MM wedges are layered to create sectors (with the sTGC wedges on the outside)~\cite{nsw_tdr}. Different stages of the constrcution process are shown in figure~\ref{fig:nsw_breakdown}.% \textcolor{red}{\textit{for if you use computer generated NSW diagram}} Sectors covered the wheel, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:nsw_diagram}. Practically, two different wedge sizes, small and large, were required to completely cover the wheel.

\section{Micromegas}
% --------------------------------------------------

Micromegas have three components: a drift plane, a gas gap, a mesh, and readout strips, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:micromega}. High voltage is applied to the readout strips. An ionization event in the gas causes electrons to drift towards the mesh. Once they arrived, they are amplified by the strong field and the avalanche is picked up by the readout electrodes. The small distance between the readout electrodes and the mesh, \SI{128}{\micro\meter}, means that positive ions are evacuated in $\sim$\SI{100}{\nano\second}, making micromegas a good choice for high rate environments~\cite{nsw_tdr}. The small pitch of the readout electrodes, \SI{0.425}{mm}, provides spatial resolution much better than \SI{100}{\micro\meter}~\cite{stelzer_new_2016}. MM quadruplets will be used for offline precision tracking~\cite{nsw_tdr}.

\section{Small-strip thin gap chambers}
% --------------------------------------------------

sTGCs are gas ionization chambers operated with a CO$_2$:n-pentane ratio of 55:45. Gold-plated tungsten wires, \SI{50}{\micro\meter} in diameter and with \SI{1.8}{mm} pitch, are suspended between two cathode planes made of FR-4, each \SI{1.4}{mm} away. One cathode board is segmented into pads of varying area (around \SI{300}{cm^2} each), and the other segmented into strips of \SI{3.2}{mm} pitch, perpendicular to the wires. High voltage is applied to the wires and the cathode planes are grounded~\cite{nsw_tdr, perez-codina_small-strip_2016}. When a muon passes through, the gas is ionized and the electric field in the gas gap causes an ionization avalanche~\cite{townsend_electricity_1915}. The motion of the ions and electrons are picked up on the nearby wire, strip and pad electrodes. The hatching of the strips and wires establishes a coordinate system from which to extract the coordinate of the muon as it passes through the layer. The graphite coating resistivity and the capacitance between the strips and pads have been tuned to optimize the rate capability. 

A 3-out-of-4 coincidence in the pad electrodes of a quadruplet will define a region of interest where the strip and wire electrodes should be readout. Then, a track segment with the required angular resolution can be constructed and provided as input to the L1 trigger~\cite{nsw_tdr}. For the next run of ATLAS (run-3), the L1 trigger will pass if the track segment from the small wheel matches a region of interest defined by the TGCs of the big wheel~\cite{tdaq_phase1_tdr, nsw_tdr}. The increased angular resolution and $\eta$ coverage of the quadruplets will be an improvement in the triggering scheme over the current SW TGCs~\cite{nsw_tdr}. After the phase-II upgrade of the trigger and data acquisition system scheduled for $\sim$2025, which includes upgrades to the big wheel's angular resolution, there will only be a trigger if the combined track points back to the interaction point, increasing the muon $p_T$ resolution~\cite{nsw_tdr, tdaq_phase2_tdr}. 

Signal is readout from groups of successive wires, so the position resolution in the direction perpendicular to the wires is $\sim$\SI{10}{mm}. The resolution in this direction does not matter since it will give the symmetric azimuthal coordinate in ATLAS. Good resolution on the $\eta$ coordinate, perpendicular to the strips, is important~\cite{nsw_tdr}. The average single chamber position resolution in the strip coordinate was \SI{45}{\micro\meter} for perpendicular muon tracks as measured in a test beam~\cite{abusleme_performance_2016}~--- well within design specifications. When four sTGCs are glued together into a quadruplet the design angular resolution of \SI{1}{mrad} in the strip coordinate is achievable~\cite{nsw_tdr, perez-codina_small-strip_2016}. 

Therefore, sTGCs are able to meet the precision tracking and triggering goals they were designed for. To ensure they can deliver once installed in ATLAS, knowing the position of the strips to within their position resolution in the ATLAS coordinate system is necessary. The NSW alignment system, detailed in section~\ref{sec:nsw_alignment} monitors the position of alignment platforms installed on the surface of the wedges. The alignment platforms are installed with respect to an external reference on the sTGCs: two brass inserts on each strip layer on one of the angled sides of each quadruplet (shown in figure~\ref{fig:brasses}). So the challenge of positioning the strips in ATLAS can be separated into two steps: first, position the strips with respect to the brass inserts; second use the alignment system to position the alignment platforms. The next section provides some pertinent details on the sTGC construction process, with steps that affect the position of the strips highlighted.
% The position of the strips can be separated into two stages. First, the NSW alignment system monitors the position of alignment platforms installed on the surface of the wedges, as detailed in section~\ref{nsw_alignment}. Second, the internal geometry of the chambers must be referenced with respect to the wedges. Parts of the sTGC construction process that affect the position of the strips are explained in section~\ref{sec:stgc_construction}. The chapter closes

% However, the accuracy of the hit positions on each layer depends on how well the position of the strips are known in the ATLAS coordinate system. 

% Each strip cathode board has two brass inserts, one near the long edge and one near the short edge, pictured in figure~\ref{fig:brasses}. The inserts were used to align the strip layers of a quadruplet during construction. They were supposed to control the position of the strips to within \SI{40}{\micro\meter} within nominal. The idea was that the NSW alignment system would monitor the position of points on the surface of an sTGC wedge (discussed in section~\ref{sec:nsw_alignment}) and that the combined external and internal alignment uncertainty on the strip positions would be acceptably small for the precision tracking goals~\cite{nsw_tdr}. Uncontrolled offsets of strip positions on an sTGC layer will bias the reconstructed hit position and hence the track, reducing accuracy of the momentum measurement. To understand the source of offsets in strip positions and misalignments between strip layers, pertinent details of the sTGC construction process are presented in the next section.

% In addition, the sTGC quadruplets should be able to provide precision tracking within \SI{100}{\micro\meter} per plane in the event of a MM module failure.

\section{sTGC Quadruplet Construction}

\label{sec:stgc_construction}

\textcolor{red}{Can I add photos? I found some on the public TRIUMF website of the graphite spraying. Can't find many from Carleton. Where am I allowed to get photos from?}

Five countries were responsible for producing the sTGC modules of varying geometries for the NSW: Canada, Chile, China, Israel and Russia. Canada was responsible for 1/4 of the required sTGCs, of three different quadruplet geometries. The steps of the construction process in each country were similar~\cite{nsw_tdr}. The process followed in Canada is detailed.

TRIUMF in Vancouver, British Columbia was responsible for preparing the cathode boards. The boards were made and the electrodes etched at a commercial laboratory, Triangle Labs, in Carson City, Nevada. Once completed they were sent to TRIUMF to be sprayed with graphite and otherwise prepared~\cite{carlson_results_2019}. The boards are commercial multilayer printed circuit boards, but the strip boards required precision machining to etch the strip pattern~\cite{nsw_tdr}. A coordinate measuring machine (CMM) or FaroArm was used to digitize each strip. Four quality parameters describing non-conformities in the strip pattern of each board were derived from the data and the results are available on a QA/QC database. The parameters and the so-called CMM data is described in full in Carlson's thesis~\cite{carlson_results_2019}. Triangle Labs also machined the two brass inserts into each strip board. Due to time constraints, tolerances on the non-conformities in the etched strip pattern with respect to the brass inserts were loosened, with the condition that the strip positions would have to be corrected for~\cite{carlson_results_2019}. 

The prepared boards were sent to Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario for construction into sTGCs and quadruplets. First, the wires were wound around the pad cathode boards using a rotating table and the wires soldered into place. Then, a wound pad cathode board was held by vacuum on a granite table, flat to within \SI{20}{\micro\meter} and a strip cathode board glued on top to create an sTGC. Holding one sTGC flat with the vacuum, another was glued on top to create a doublet, then two doublets were glued together to create a quadruplet. When gluing sTGCs together, the brass inserts were pushed against alignment pins with the goal of keeping the strip layers aligned within tolerance. However, non-conformities in the shape of the brass inserts and the position of the alignment pins resulted in misalignments between the brass inserts and strips on successive layers. Precise alignment of the pad boards or wires with respect to the strip boards did not have to be so tightly controlled because pads do not measure the precision coordinate. 

The Carleton team finished the quadruplets by installing adaptor boards on the angled sides that allow front end electronics to be attached to each layer to readout the electrodes. Completed quadruplets were sent to McGill University where they were characterized with cosmic rays. The details of cosmic ray testing are described in chapter~\ref{chap:cosmics}. Quadruplets were then sent to CERN where they were assembled into wedges and alignment platforms installed. The alignment platforms were installed using a jig positioned with respect to the brass inserts. Completed wedges were assembled into sectors then installed on the NSWs.

% So, during cathode board construction the etched strip pattern could be shifted off of nominal with respect to the brass inserts. While gluing sTGCs together, non-conformities in the shapes of the brasses and the position of the alignment pins resulted in misalignments between the brass inserts that mean they are not a uniform reference for every layer of the quadruplet. 

The board construction process had two steps where strip positions could be shifted off of nominal. First, there could be non-conformities in the etched strip pattern, described by the four quality parameters~\cite{carlson_results_2019}. Second, non-conformities in the shape of the brass inserts and in the position of the alignment pins resulted in misalignments between strips on different layers. The result was that the brass inserts were not a reliable reference point and strips can be offset from their design position by up to hundreds of micrometers. Offsets in strip positions from nominal in Canadian quadruplets were shown to be random~\cite{carlson_results_2019}, so no one correction would suffice. The offsets must be measured and corrected for in the ATLAS offline software, \package{Athena}, which is responsible for precision tracking. Understanding the work ongoing to make measurements of offsets and correct for them requires understanding the main strategy used by the NSW alignment system.

% Two sources of misalignment resulted at board level: non-conformities in the placement and shape of the brass inserts and non-conformities in the strip pattern. Carlson addressed the non-conformities in the strip pattern of Canadian cathode boards in his thesis~\cite{carlson_results_2019}. A coordinate measuring machine (CMM) or FaroArm was used to digitize the etched strip pattern of each board. Four quality parameters describing non-conformities in the strip pattern were derived from the data and the results are available on a QA/QC database. The parameters were offset, angle (rotation), scale and non-parallelism, defined in ful in Carlson' thesis. Often, alignment models only consider an offset and rotation. 

% Once the cathode boards were prepared, they were sent to TRIUMF in Vancouver, British Columbia to be sprayed with the graphite coating. After spraying, the coating was polished until the resistivity was between 90 and \SI{110}{\kilo\ohm}$/\msquare$, then wire support structures and frames were installed~\cite{nsw_tdr}. The completed boards were sent to Carleton university for construction into gas gaps and multiplets.

% First, anode wires were wound onto the the pad cathode boards using a rotating vacuum table. Then, a pad and strip cathode board has to be glued together to create an sTGC, two sTGCs glued together to create a doublet, and two doublets glued together to create a quadruplet. Gluing was done by holding one side of a cathode board in place with vacuum on a granite table, flat to within \SI{20}{\micro\meter}. A honey comb spacer separates each sTGC layer of a quadruplet. When closing a gas gap, micrometer misalignments between the strip and pad cathode boards do not matter since the pads do not measure precision coordinates. When gluing sTGCs into doublets however, alignment between strip layers had to be controlled by pushing the two brass inserts against alignment pins~--- similarly for gluing together doublets. Once a quadruplet was assembled, adapator boards used to route the electrodes' signals to the front end electronics were soldered on to the angled sides of the quadruplet~\cite{nsw_tdr}. 

% If you want to include the x-ray survery of the brass positions and the microscope method
% At every stage in the process quality control checks were in place for gas, high voltage, and alignment. For alignment, \textcolor{red}{the position of the brasses were recorded in 3D using an x-ray gun~\cite{nsw_tdr} \textit{--> Did this actually happen?}}~\cite{nsw_tdr} and alignment between strips visible outside a quadruplet was checked with a microscope~\cite{carlson_results_2019}. 

% Quality control tests of alignment, ability to hold high voltage, gas sealing etc. were undertaken at every stage in the construction process~-- details can be found in~\cite{nsw_tdr}. The final set of quality control checks and characterization was done at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. Completed quadruplets were tested for gas leaks, noise and characterized with cosmic rays. The details of cosmic ray testing are described in chapter~\ref{chap:cosmics}.

% Once the quadruplets have been tested with cosmics rays, they are sent to CERN to be further tested, assembled into wedges then sectors, then installed on the NSWs. At the time of writing, all sectors have been installed on both wheels. The first NSW has been lowered into the ATLAS cavern and is being commissioned. The second is scheduled for installation in October, 2021.

\section{NSW alignment}
% --------------------------------------------------
\label{sec:nsw_alignment}
%TODO : Mention Athena
% The idea of the NSW alignment system is presented in~\cite{nsw_tdr}, but the details have only been presented internally so far. The original goal of the alignment system was to provide the position with respect to one another of any three chambers traversable by a muon track with an accuracy of \SI{40}{\micro\meter} in the precision coordinate~\cite{nsw_tdr}. Likely for sTGCs, this will mean inputing the strip postions, or parameters to calculate the strip positions, into the ATLAS experiment's offline software, \package{Athena}.

%TODO : 
\textcolor{red}{What figures can I use to show the bars, the alignment jig, the platforms and the optical fibres?}.

The idea of the NSW alignment system is presented in~\cite{nsw_tdr}, but the details have only been presented internally so far. After the wedges are constructed, alignment platforms are installed on every sTGC quadruplet and optical fibres routed to them. Light from the optical fibres will be monitored in real time by cameras (BCAMs) mounted on the alignment bars of the NSWs. The system will thus record the positions of the alignment platforms in the ATLAS coordinate system, accessible at any point during operation \textcolor{red}{Camila Pazos, 2021-02-01 and Chris Armstrong 2021-02-02 during muon week https://indico.cern.ch/event/983500/}. % The final link in the sTGC alignment system requires knowing the position of the strips inside a chamber with respect to the alignment platforms.

% If you want to mention the alignment jig in the last paragraph:
% They are positioned with the help of an alignment jig, which is like a frame that can be positioned on top of a wedge with cut outs indicating the correct position for the alignment platforms. The jig is positioned with respect to the brass inserts \textcolor{red}{[Benoit 2020-01-20, 2020-04-16 presentations]}.

% The goal was to control the position of the strips in the chamber to within ~\SI{40}{\micro\meter} for precision tracking goals~\cite{nsw_tdr} --- then knowing the position of the brass inserts with respect to the alignment platforms would allow the strips to be positioned accurately enough. That is the alignment scheme shown in solid arrows in figure~\ref{fig:alignment_elements}. Due to time constraints, tolerances on the non-conformities in the etched strip pattern were loosened, with the condition that the strips positions would have to be corrected for in the software~\cite{carlson_results_2019}. Then, non-conformities in the brass inserts, misalignment of the pins the brass inserts were pushed against, and shifts of the strip layers while the glue was curing resulted in misalignments between the brass inserts~-- and between the strips layers ~-- that prevent using the brasses as an external reference of the position of the strips. The misalignments between Canadian sTGCs were shown to be random~\cite{carlson_results_2019}, so no one correction would suffice.

% The original alignment scheme was to use the brass inserts as a reference between the alignment platforms and the individual strips, as shown in the solid arrows in figure~\ref{fig:alignment_elements}. \textcolor{red}{Due to time constraints, tolerances on the non-conformities in the etched strip pattern with respect to the brass inserts were loosened, with the condition that the strips positions would have to be corrected for. Corrections will happen in ATLAS offline software, \package{Athena}, that will do the precision tracking~\cite{carlson_results_2019}. --> MOVE THIS} Moreover, non-conformities in the shape of the brass inserts and the alignment pins added misalignment between the inserts of different layers~-- and between the strips of different layers~-- that prevent using the brass inserts as a reference. Offsets in strip positions from nominal in Canadian quadruplets were shown to be random~\cite{carlson_results_2019}, so no one correction would suffice.
%TODO : Did other construction sites have this problem?

    \caption{How the different elements of the sTGC alignment system relate to one another. The solid arrows denote the planned alignment scheme. The dashed arrow shows the modification being finalized now. This figure is based off of \textcolor{red}{Benoit's presentation, 2021-01-30.}}
    \label{fig:alignment_elements}
\end{figure}

The original alignment scheme was to use the brass inserts as a reference between the alignment platforms and the individual strips, as shown in the solid arrows in figure~\ref{fig:alignment_elements}, which will no longer work. The position of the alignment platforms will still be known in ATLAS thanks to the alignment system, so a different method to get the position of the individual strips with respect to the alignment platform is currently in its final stages. It uses the yet-unmentioned x-ray dataset to calculate offsets of the strip pattern of an sTGC layer in a local area (local offset) with respect to the alignment platforms directly. Effectively, the reference to the brass inserts is skipped, represented as the dashed line in figure~\ref{fig:alignment_elements}. The goal of this thesis is to validate the x-ray local strip pattern offsets with cosmic muon data. In chapter~\ref{chap:cosmics}, how cosmic muon data collection and processing is done at McGill University is presented. Chapter~\ref{chap:cosmics_for_alignment} and \textcolor{red}{CHAPTER XRAY} detail how measurements of local strip pattern offsets are measured with cosmic muon data and x-ray data. In chapter~\ref{chap:comparison}, cosmic muon and x-ray local strip pattern offsets are compared to validate the x-ray dataset. Finally, in chapter~\ref{chap:outlook}, the context of these results in the alignment scheme is presented.

% Snippets
%The main dataset was collected using x-rays as the probe. The x-ray data has been combined with the CMM data to create an alignment model that can be used to estimate the position of each strip. The goal of this work was to validate the measurements of strip pattern offsets done with the x-ray dataset with the cosmic muon data. Currently, only modules made in Canada have been analyzed in this way, but the method applies for other countries that were able to collect cosmic muon data on multiple quadruplet layers. 

%Moreover, as-built alignment parameters must be measured and extracted to ensure proper function and provide a way to correct for misalignment. The next section breaks down the sTGC construction process to highlight the stages of alignment.
%All countries successfully finished delivering their modules this year, and the sectors have been installed on the NSWs.
