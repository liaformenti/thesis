\chapter{Using cosmic muon data to position strips}
\label{chap:cosmics_for_positioning}

Three methods were used to characterize each quadruplet's alignment: the CMM method, cosmic ray tracing and x-ray profile reconstruction. For present purposes, the CMM method was described sufficiently in the introduction. The x-ray method is detailed at the end of this chapter (section~\ref{sec:x_ray}). How cosmic ray tracing was used for alignment studies, with the goal of independently validating the x-ray method, is the main focus of this chapter and this thesis.

\section{Measuring local offsets in strip pattern using cosmics data}
% --------------------------------------------------

Misalignments can be modeled as passive transformations. Ideally, a misalignment model would be chosen and the parameters (for example, a global offset and rotation for each layer) calculated. To understand the potential of cosmic muon data, it is useful to define a local offset. For each area of a strip layer, the local offset is the shift of the strip pattern in that area with respect to the nominal geometry.  Local offsets systematically change the strip that is hit by a muon passing through the area. The \package{tgc\_analysis/CosmicsAnalysis} software assumes the nominal geometry, so the recorded muon y-position ($y$) is shifted opposite to the local offset ($d_{local}$),
% Maybe useful sentence?: The local offset is a result of the non-conformities in the strip pattern etching and inter-layer misalignments.
\begin{equation}
    y = y_{nom} - d_{local},
    \label{eqn:local_translation}
\end{equation}
% Maybe useful sentence?: The true position of individual cosmic muons is not known, and in the analysis the four detector planes float with respect to a software-implemented origin that is not associated with a fixed physical location.
where $y_{nom}$ is the position of the muon that would have been recorded if there was no local offset. Equation~\ref{eqn:local_translation} ignores other factors that could affect the cluster position (like position resolution). The local offset is unknown and there was no external reference to measure $y_{nom}$. Therefore, only relative alignment parameters can be extracted. 

The minimal relative coordinate system uses two reference or fixed layers~\cite{lefebvre_thesis}. The hits on the two fixed layers were used to create tracks that can be interpolated or extrapolated (polated) to the other two layers. The residual of track $i$, $\Delta_i$ is defined as,
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_i = y_{i,hit} - y_{i,track},
    \label{eqn:residual}
\end{equation}

where $y_{i,hit}$ is the recorded hit position and $y_{i,track}$ is the polated track position built from hits on the two reference layers. Track residuals are affected by the local offset in the area of each layer's hit. As an example, in figure~\ref{fig:fake_event_display}, the residual on layer 2 perhaps indicates that layer 2 is offset with respect to layers 1 and 4 in the area of the track. Of course, a single track residual says nothing of the real relative local offset because of the limited spatial resolution of the detectors and fake tracks caused by noise or delta rays. However, the mean of residuals for all tracks in a region will be shifted systematically by the local offsets between layers~\cite{lefebvre_thesis}. For a perfectly aligned quadruplet, the mean of residuals should be zero in all regions and for all reference frames, unlike the example regions shown in figure~\ref{fig:res_dist}.

\label{fig:res_dist}
\end{figure}

The residual distributions were wider for tracking combinations where the extrapolation lever arm was largest. In general, residual means calculated with geometrically less favourable tracking combinations have larger statistical and systematic uncertainties. The bin size of \SI{200}{\micro\meter} for the distributions shown in figure~\ref{fig:res_dist} was chosen based on the uncertainty on residuals calculated from tracks on layer 4 (1) built from hits on layers 1 and 2 (3 and 4) given a cluster y-position uncertainty of \SI{60}{\micro\meter} (appendix~\ref{sec:appendix_clustering_track_residuals}), since these tracks yield residuals with the largest uncertainties.

A gaussian fit was used to extract the mean of the residual distributions. Theoretically, a double gaussian distribution is more apt, but for this analysis the gaussian fit was sufficient, as discussed in appendix~\ref{appendix:systematics_res_fit_fcn}.

The area of the region of interest was \SI{100}{\milli\meter} by \SI{100}{\milli\meter}. The size balanced the amount of tracks falling in the region of interest to give sufficient statistics to the local residual distributions, while being smaller than the order on which misalignments were expected to effect the local offsets significantly. "Significantly" in this context was defined based on the distance in $x$ that a large but possible rotation of \SI{1000}{\micro\radian} would change the local offset by more than \SI{50}{\micro\meter}, which is half the required position resolution of the sTGCs~\cite{nsw_tdr}.

It is only possible to calculate relative local offsets with cosmics data because there was no external reference to measure positions on all layers with respect to. As an example, assuming that the residual on layer 2 in figure~\ref{fig:fake_event_display} is representative of the relative local offset, the residual on layer 2 could be caused by layer 2 being misaligned from nominal, but it could also be caused by layers 1 and 4 being misaligned from nominal while layer 2 is in its expected position! Any number of combinations of local offsets on layers 1, 2 and 4 could produce the residual on layer 2. The value of relative local offset measurements will be shown and discussed throughout this work.

\section{Visualizing relative misalignments between layers}
% --------------------------------------------------

The mean of residuals was extracted for regions across entire quadruplet layers for every tracking combination to get a picture of the relative misalignments between layers.

\label{fig:res_mean_th2}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:res_mean_th2} contains the mean of residuals on layers 2 and 4 with tracking reference layers 1 and 3. Many of the residual means are non-zero, and change smoothly over the layer, indicating that there are relative misalignments. Given that the residual mean changes with $x$ in figure~\ref{fig:res_mean_th2_L2_F13}, there is likely a rotation of layer 2 with respect to layers 1 and 3, combined with an offset of the entire layer. For layer 4 in figure~\ref{fig:res_mean_th2_L4_F13}, perhaps there is a scaling~\cite{carlson_results_2019} of the strip pattern with respect to layers 1 and 3. The interpretation of the patterns in the residual means depends on the choice of misalignment model.

\section{Systematic uncertainty in cosmic residual means}
% --------------------------------------------------

The statistical uncertainty on the local residual means was typically around \SI{10}{} - \SI{20}{\micro\meter}, and appendix~\ref{appendix:statistics} shows that the analysis was not statistically limited by the number of triggers collected for each quadruplet. The systematic uncertainties were more significant. 

Systematic uncertainties were assigned per tracking combination as the RMS of the distribution of the difference in local residual means each calculated with a different analysis choice. For example, the RMS associated with fitting the local residual distributions with a Gaussian or double Gaussian is \SI{25}{\micro\meter} for the geometrically least favourable tracking combinations and the distribution is shown in appendix~\ref{appendix:systematics_res_fit_fcn}. For geometrically similar tracking combinations (like: tracks on layer 1 built from hits on layers 3 and 4, and tracks on layer 4 built from hits on layers 1 and 2), the systematic uncertainty was assigned as the average RMS for both.

Other choices were whether to use data collected at 2.9~kV or 3.1~kV; what cluster fitting algorithm to use; and whether or not to apply a differential non-linearity (DNL) correction to the cluster y-positions. A systematic uncertainty was assigned using the method above to account for the effect of each choice. The reasons for each choice are listed below.

Data taken at 3.1~kV was used over 2.9~kV because the strip and wire tracking efficiency increases with higher voltage~\cite{lefebvre_thesis} (appendix~\ref{appendix:systematics_2900V_vs_3100V}).

The \package{Minuit2} package~\cite{hatlo_developments_2005} was used to fit clusters over Guo's method~\cite{guo_simple_2011} because it provided automatic statistical uncertainty estimates and is the standard choice (appendix~\ref{appendix:systematics_cluster_fit_fcn}).

The DNL correction was not applied because its effect on the residual means was negligible (appendix~\ref{appendix:systematics_dnl}).

A summary of the systematic uncertainties assigned for each tracking combination is given in table~\ref{tab:sys_uncerts}.

\end{table}

The uncertainty in each mean cosmics residual was assigned as the sum in quadrature of the statistical uncertainty in the mean and the appropriate systematic uncertainty for the tracking combination. Given that the uncertainty in the mean cosmics residuals is lesser than or near to the order of the required position resolution of the sTGCs (\SI{100}{\micro\meter}~\cite{nsw_tdr}) the cosmic residual means are relevant input for alignment studies.
