The goal was to validate the local offsets extracted from the x-ray data with cosmics data. The complication was that the x-ray dataset provided absolute local offsets while the cosmics dataset provided relative local offsets, which could not be compared directly. The solution was to analyze the x-ray data in the same relative coordinate system as the cosmics data. The  results of the comparison are presented here.

Scatter plots of the x-ray and mean cosmics residuals for two sample quadruplets in figures~\ref{fig:correlation} and \ref{fig:no_correlation} reveal the degree of correlation between the datasets.

First, the fitted slope and offset in figure~\ref{fig:correlation} show that the two QL2.P.11 datasets are correlated. However, the magnitude of the uncertainties in the x-ray residuals is large. The large uncertainty set a limit on the sensitivity of the analysis, for if the absolute value of the x-ray residuals of a quadruplet were smaller than the x-ray residual uncertainties, no conclusion about the correlation could be drawn, like for QL2.P.8 (figure~\ref{fig:no_correlation}).

Several quadruplets were tested for each quadruplet construction geometry built in Canada. Each quadruplet fell into one of the two categories: residuals large enough to see a correlation, or residuals too small to see a correlation. Since the x-ray and mean cosmics residuals were measures of the relative local offsets between the layer of a quadruplet and the two reference layers, quadruplets with the most relative misalignment had the largest range of residuals. So, the correlation plots were an easy visual way to identify quadruplets with large relative misalignments.

Residuals calculated with all tracking combinations are included in figures~\ref{fig:correlation} and \ref{fig:no_correlation}. There are three patterns in the residuals on the scatter plot explained by geometry. First, for both datasets the uncertainty in the extrapolated track residuals were larger than the interpolated track residuals because of the extrapolation lever arm. For the x-ray residuals, the effect of the lever arm on the uncertainty was direct since the residual was calculated from a single abstracted track; for the cosmics residuals it was the widening of the residual distribution on the layer of interest due to the extrapolation lever arm that increased the statistical uncertainty in the fitted mean of residuals and how precisely the effect of systematic choices could be measured. Second, residuals calculated through extrapolation tend to be larger because the extrapolation lever arm can produce more extreme values. Third, the pattern of points in figure~\ref{fig:correlation} is slightly mirrored. This is expected since the residuals calculated for a given set of three layers should be geometrically correlated. 

The correlation of the cosmics residuals with the x-ray residuals alone does not validate the method; all the studies in described in appendices~\ref{appendix:statistics} and ~\ref{appendix:systematics} demonstrate its robustness. The analysis could be validated externally by comparing the mean cosmics residuals to the relative alignment parameters calculated using \package{tgc\_analysis/MatrixMethod}~\cite{lefebvre_tgc_analysis} and JOHN FLORES CHI2 METHOD.

\section{Discussion}
% --------------------------------------------------
The most important limit on measuring the degree of correlation between the x-ray and cosmics residuals was the uncertainty on the x-ray residuals, which stemmed from the systematic uncertainty in the x-ray beam profile centers~\cite{lefebvre_precision_2020}. The method was limited primarily by the sTGCs' poor x-ray position resolution, since x-rays do not create real tracks anyways. 

The analysis of certain quadruplets was also limited by the availability of data. Sometimes, less than three layers were surveyed for a given x-ray gun position so no residuals could be calculated. Too few x-ray residuals prevented the analysis from detecting a significant correlation if it would even be measurable. Often, the analysis of smaller quadruplets (placed innermost on the wheel) suffered as a result because they had fewer alignment platforms, and hence gun positions, on their surfaces. In addition, the analysis was limited to certain quadruplets. The wedges constructed the earliest (typically small wedges) were surveyed when the method was still being designed and so have limited x-ray residuals calculated from beam profiles of lower quality. Also, not all cosmic muon test sites had enough front end electronics to collect data on three layers simultaneously, which is the minimum required to be able to calculate residuals.

Nonetheless, the comparison of x-ray and cosmics residuals was really to confirm the x-ray method's ability to measure local offsets with an independent dataset. The x-ray absolute local offsets allow the calculation of relative local offsets that can be correlated to the cosmics relative local offsets. Therefore, the analysis of quadruplets with relative local offsets large enough to detect a correlation validates the x-ray method's ability to measure local offsets. The potential of using relative local offsets calculated from cosmics data to study relative alignment between sTGC layers stands on its own. It is especially compelling considering how much smaller the uncertainties in the relative local offsets are compared to the x-ray data.
