Making x-ray residual plots where arrow starts from expected x-ray beam
position and goes up by the x-ray residual by x500.

Note that QL2P11_xray_residuals.csv comes from 3100V data taken on 2021-08-05.
The csv file is QL2P11_xray_residuals.txt in the 2021-08-05 folder, but with
the units and final comma on the header line removed, and spaces between the
header names removed so its reads into pandas correctly.

Similarly for QL2P08_xray_residuals.csv. Comes from 3100V data take on
2021-08-03. 

On your PC you store the data on /c/Users/User/OneDrive - McGill
University/Documents/Masters/sTGCWork/stripPosWithCosmics/residualsStudy/QUAD_VOLT.
