The NSW uses two kinds of detector technologies: sTGC (small-strip Thin Gap Chambers) and MM (Micromegas). The sTGC is developed, being produced and tested in the recent years. This paper describes the construction and the cosmic test of sTGC in Shandong University, focusing on its performance after integrating with the specific electronics.},

	abstract = {The muon spectrometer of the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN consists of 1182 muon chambers for precision track measurements, arranged in three concentric cylinders in the barrel region, and in four wheels in each of the two endcaps. The endcap wheels are located between 7 m and 22 m from the interaction point, and have diameters between 13 m and 24 m. Muon chambers are equipped with a complex optical alignment system to monitor their positions and deformations during ATLAS data-taking. We describe the layout of the endcap part of the alignment system and the design and calibration of the optical sensors, as well as the various software components. About 1\% of the system has been subjected to performance tests in the H8 beam line at CERN, and results of these tests are discussed. The installation and commissioning of the full system in the ATLAS cavern has been completed, and the analysis of the first data indicates that it performs already now at a level close to the goal of a 40 μm alignment accuracy, ultimately required for reconstructing high-momentum final-state muons with the desired momentum resolution of 10\% at 1 TeV.},
