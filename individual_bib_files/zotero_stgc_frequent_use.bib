	abstract = {The ATLAS muon system upgrade to be installed during the LHC long shutdown in 2018/19, the so-called New Small Wheel (NSW), is designed to cope with the increased instantaneous luminosity in LHC Run 3. The small-strip Thin Gap Chambers (sTGC) will provide the NSW with a fast trigger and high precision tracking. The construction protocol has been validated by test beam experiments on a full-size prototype sTGC detector, showing the performance requirements are met. The intrinsic spatial resolution for a single layer has been found to be about 45 μm for a perpendicular incident angle, and the transition region between pads has been measured to be about 4 mm.},

The largest phase 1 upgrade project for the ATLAS Muon System is the replacement of the present ﬁrst station in the forward regions with the so-called New Small Wheels (NSWs), to be installed during the LHC long shutdown in 2018/19. The NSWs consist of eight layers each of Micromegas and small-strip Thin Gap Chambers (sTGC), both providing trigger and tracking capabilities, for a total active surface of more than 2500 m2. It represents the ﬁrst system with such a large size based on Micro Pattern (Micromegas) and wire detectors (sTGC). The technological novelties and the expected performance of the NSW system are discussed. The status of the project and the plan for the completion are summarized.},

	abstract = {The instantaneous luminosity of the Large Hadron Collider at CERN will be increased up to a factor of five with respect to the present design value by undergoing an extensive upgrade program over the coming decade. The most important upgrade project for the ATLAS Muon System is the replacement of the present first station in the forward regions with the so-called New Small Wheels (NSWs). The NSWs will be installed during the LHC long shutdown in 2018/19. Small-Strip Thin Gap Chamber (sTGC) detectors are designed to provide fast trigger and high precision muon tracking under the high luminosity LHC conditions. To validate the design, a full-size prototype sTGC detector of approximately 1.2 \${\textbackslash}times\$ \$1.0{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{m\}{\textasciicircum}2\$ consisting of four gaps has been constructed. Each gap provides pad, strip and wire readouts. The sTGC intrinsic spatial resolution has been measured in a \$32{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{GeV\}\$ pion beam test at Fermilab. At perpendicular incidence angle, single gap position resolutions of about \$50{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textbackslash}mu m\}\$ have been obtained, uniform along the sTGC strip and perpendicular wire directions, well within design requirements. Pad readout measurements have been performed in a \$130{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{GeV\}\$ muon beam test at CERN. The transition region between readout pads has been found to be \$4{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mm\}\$, and the pads have been found to be fully efficient.},

	abstract = {Over the course of the next ten years, the LHC will undergo upgrades that will more than triple its current luminosity. This increase in luminosity will put greater demands on the ATLAS trigger system. To meet these demands, the Small Wheels of the muon spectrometer will be replaced with the New Small Wheels (NSWs) during Long Shutdown 2. The NSWs employ two gaseous detector technologies - small-strip Thin Gap Chambers (sTGCs) and Micromegas. To characterize the sTGCs, a series of test beams were conducted on a production sTGC module at the H8 beamline of CERN’s Super Proton Synchrotron. The setup and results of the test beams are presented, and it has been found that the detector meets the performance requirements of the NSW for efficiency and multiplicity at several operating voltages. 
 
To meet the performance requirements of the NSW, the positions of the detector elements must be precisely known. Quality control measurements were made during construction of the sTGC strip cathode boards to allow for the reconstruction of individual strip positions. A transformation from the nominal strip geometry to the as-built geometry is derived based on the QC measurements. This transformation was tested against microscope and cosmic ray misalignment measurements. The as-built predictions agree well with the misalignment measurements, demonstrating the ability to reconstruct the strip positions from the QC measurements.},
